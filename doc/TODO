TODO
====

- Adapt man page to new options
- Port script to Win32 through an extension to the file system operations so that they work operation system independent
- Reenable the site installation feature: Move the remaining parts of a BASH script to PHP
- Remove database.sql (the version in the site package should be used, instead)
