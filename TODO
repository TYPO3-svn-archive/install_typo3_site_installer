TODO
====

- Adapt man page to new options

- Port script to Win32 through an extension to the file system
  operations so that they work operation system independent

- Reenable the site installation feature: Move the remaining parts of
  a BASH script to PHP load the required SQL from typo3.org (if Debian
  package is not provided)

- Remove database.sql (the version in the site package should be used, instead)

- check for appropriate apache and php configuration
