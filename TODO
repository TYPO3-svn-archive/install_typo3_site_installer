typo3-site-installer - TODO
===========================


- install apache.conf from Templates (one template for virtualhosts,
   one for a single host) for apache 1.3 and 2.0; enable safe sites
   and reload apache (leutloff@debian.org is working on this,
   09.05.05)


- install localconf.php from Templates(leutloff@debian.org is working on this,
   09.05.05)


- My (Michael Stucki) idea was something like this inside of /etc/typo3/:

   System-wide defaults: Default settings for each of these
   products. File is included from site-localconf (sitewide default
   configuration, see below).

   - defaults/graphicsmagick.inc
   - defaults/imagemagick4-2-9.inc
   - defaults/imagemagick5-4-4.inc
   - defaults/imagemagick6.inc
   - defaults/gd-only.inc

   Site-wide defaults: Default settings for one specific site
   (e.g. database name, db user, etc.). Included from the top of
   typo3conf/localconf.php.

   - sites/www-mydomain-com.localconf.php
   - sites/www.anotherdomain-ch.localconf.php

   The idea of this is to have a completely modular site
   configuration. A whole site can be backupped to another server with
   different database connection settings but the configuration is
   placed at the same position in the path.


- create empty database and appropriate user in the MySQL-Server


- use symlic to a concrete TYPO3 source version instead of the symlink
   lastet


- Reenable the site installation feature:

   Move the remaining parts of a BASH script to PHP load the required
   SQL from typo3.org (if Debian package is not provided)

   Install (dummy, quickstart, testsite) as templates but not as
   instances and use the site-installer to set them up.

   Alloy multiple instances of the quickstart site running and
   let web hosters use the typo3-site-installer.


- site config files (located in /etc/typo3/?) to enable/disable both
   install tool (as everything is already done correctly, the install
   tool is disabled by default) and the whole backend with just two
   lines.

- set an initial password for the admin user of the backend

- allow installation of multiple instances from the given packages
   (dummy, quickstart, testsite)


- get t3d from typo3.org (and save them as tar.gz and build then
   appropiate Debian packages) - install dummy, quickstart, testsite
   from t3d plus common extensions (Thomas Barth is working on this,
   09.05.05)


- check local installation for enabled php and loaded gd and mysql
   extensions



- Adapt man page to new options



- Remove database.sql (the version in the site package should be used,
   instead)


 

- execdir - manage symlinks for the binaries in every site or/and in a
   single directory (TYPO3 already uses /usr/local/php/bin in addition
   to the ones provided by apache.conf)


- i18n

- test/adopt to other GNU/Linux distrubutions than Debian/Ubuntu

- Port script to Win32 through an extension to the file system
   operations so that they work operation system independent
